			 <strong>What to expect?</strong>
			 <br>
			 We hold two services a week here at Life Church. Both services are unique and the messages are 
			 not repeated.  Every service typically consists of praise and worship, greeting time, a brief offering, 
			 and the sermon.  Our Wednesday service tends to run under an hour and a half long, ending 
			 around 9pm, and our Sunday service typically runs under 2 hours ending at 12pm.  We have a 
			 brief reception during greeting time for our first time visitors.

			 <br> 
			 When it comes to service times the best place to park is in the back by our canopy entrance.  If you
			 are visiting during business hours than you will want to park at the side of the building where our 
			 office entrance is located.

			 Praise and worship is an important part of our services.  You can expect a mix of contemporary 
			 Christian music along with the occasional classic hymn.  Don’t worry if you don’t know the lyrics, 
			 we will project the words on the main screen to help you out.  The congregation tends to sing along 
			 with the worship team, and do not be surprised if some people become expressive in their praise by 
			 clapping or raising their hands.
