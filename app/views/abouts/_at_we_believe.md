####Detailed Statement of Beliefs
 

#####The Inspired Scriptures
The Bible is the inspired and infallible Word of God.  It is the fundamental revelation from God to man, which
contains the whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory, man’s salvation,
obedience, faith and life.  All scripture is living and powerful and derives its authority from God its author,
who is truth itself.  Therefore, the Bible is all sufficient and superior to human conscience and reason and is
the final authority for Christian faith and conduct.

######Matt 5:18, John 17:17, 2 Tim 3:15-17, Heb 1:1-2, Heb 4:12, 2 Peter 1:20-21


#####The One True God
The Lord our God is the one true God and has revealed Himself as the eternally self-existent, self-revealed
“I AM”.  By His very nature He is in every way infinite in being, perfection, power, knowledge, truth,
goodness, and love.  Through Him all things were created, and His essence cannot be fully comprehended
by any but Himself.  In this divine and infinite being there are three persons, the Father, the Word or Son, and
the Holy Spirit.  All are one in substance, power, and eternity; each having the whole divine essence, yet this
essence being undivided.  Each member of the one true triune God is equally deserving of our worship and
obedience.

######Gen 1:1, Exod 3:13-14, Deut 6:4, Psalm 50:10-12, Psalm 90:2, Is 45:5-7, Is 48:12-13, Matt 28:19, John 1:1-3, Acts 17:24-25, 1 Cor 8:4, 2 Cor 13:14, Col 2:9, Rev 1:8


#####The Fall of the Human Race
Man was directly and immediately created by God, for His glory, in His image and likeness. The first man,
Adam, was created free of sin with a rational nature, intelligence, volition, self-determination, and moral
responsibility to God.  Although God created Adam upright and perfect and revealed to him His will, which
secured life while he kept it, Adam wilfully chose to disobey God’s Word.  The result of Adam’s sin was the
loss of his innocence; incurred the penalty of spiritual and physical death; became subject to the wrath of
God; and became inherently corrupt and incapable of choosing or doing that which is acceptable to God
apart from divine grace.  Since all men are in Adam, a nature corrupted by Adam’s sin has been transmitted
to all men for all ages.  Therefore, all men are sinners by nature and by choice, warranting the judgment their
sin rightly deserves.

######Gen 1:26-27, Gen 2:7, Gen 3:1-19, Psalm 51:5, Psalm 58:3, Jer 17:9, John 3:36, Rom 3:10-18, Rom 3:23, Rom 5:12-19, Rom 6:23, 1 Cor 2:14, Eph 2:1-3, Titus 1:15, 1 John 1:8 

 
#####The Salvation of the Human Race
Knowing that man was incapable of meeting the penalty resulting from his transgressions, God willingly took
upon Himself the responsibility of satisfying all the requirements His justice and holiness would demand. 
God’s plan was accomplished whereby in the fullness of time God the Father sent His incarnate Son Jesus
into the earth.  The Lord Jesus Christ, who added to His divine nature the nature of a man, died for our sins
according to the Scriptures, as a representative and substitutionary sacrifice. He bore the wrath of a most
holy God in punishing our sin upon Christ.  When God’s holiness and righteousness was satisfied He
declared it finished.  Consequently every repentant sinner who responds by faith and receives Him as Savior
and Lord is justified on the basis of Jesus Christ’s shed blood.  The Holy Spirit baptizes each believing
person into the body of Christ at the moment of salvation and empowers them to follow and serve Him.  God
graciously makes this faith available so that His elect can act in response to the Word of God, and be saved. 
The gift of salvation is wholly of God by grace on the basis of the redemption of Jesus Christ, the merit of His
shed blood, and not on the basis of human merit or works.

######John 1:12, John 3:14-18, John 6:37-40, Rom 10:8-10, 1 Cor 12:13, 2 Cor 5:21, Eph 1:3-10, Eph 2:8-10, Heb 12: 2, Titus 3:4-7, 1 Peter 1:18-19


#####A New Creation in Christ
Those who are united to Christ by grace through faith according to scripture effectively become a new
creation, instantaneously being sanctified unto God by justification and declared to be holy.  The Believer is
regenerated, having their old sin nature removed and a new heart and spirit created in them through virtue of
Christ’s death and resurrection. In addition to addressing the Believer’s eternal position and standing,
provision was made for their present state and the mortification of the flesh which battles against the Spirit. 
The believer is progressively brought closer to the likeness of Christ and lives a life of increasing holiness in
conformity to the will of God through obedience to the Word of God and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.

######Ezek 36:25-27, John 3:5-6, John 17:17, Rom 6:1-22, 1 Cor 6:11, 1 Cor 10:13, 2 Cor 3:18, 2 Cor 5:17, Gal 5:19-24, Col 3:5-10, 1 Thes 4:3-5, 2 Thes 2:13, 2 Tim 2:20-23,  Heb 10:10, Heb 13:12, 1 Peter 2:2, 2 Peter 1:2-10

 
#####The Work & Gifts of the Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit has many functions, roles, and activities.  In the world He predominantly works in the hearts of
all people everywhere convicting them of sin and righteousness and judgement.  After baptizing the believer
into the body of Christ He continues His ministry by helping, comforting, guiding, revealing the truth, and
producing fruit in the believers life.  In addition, and for the common good, the Holy Spirit gives gifts to
believers in order that we may function as the body of Christ on earth. All of these gifts, both great and small,
are given by the Spirit so that we may be His ambassadors to the world, showing forth His grace and glorifying
Him.  The gifts of the Holy Spirt are His and are apportioned as He wills.

######John 14:16, John 16:7-15, Acts 1:8, 1 Cor 2:12-16, 1 Cor 12:1-31, Gal 5:22-23


#####The Local Church
All who place their faith in Jesus Christ are immediately engrafted by the Holy Spirit into one united spiritual
body, the Universal Church, the bride of Christ of which Christ is the head.  Although the Church is a unique
spiritual organism in which all Believers are united, it manifests its practical expression in the formation and
continuation of local assemblies. Christ is the one supreme authority for the local assembly and all leadership,
gifts, order, discipline, and worship in the church are appointed through Him.  There are biblically designated
officers serving under Christ and over the assembly to whom He has given His authority in directing the church. 
The officers appointed by Christ to be chosen and set apart by the church are elders (also called bishops,
pastors, and pastor-teachers) and deacons, both of whom must meet biblical qualifications.  The purpose of
the church is to glorify God by building itself up in the faith, by the instruction of the Word, by fellowship, by
keeping ordinances, and by advancing and communicating the gospel to the entire world.  The local church is
also the vehicle through which Christ equips His saints for the work of the ministry through discipleship,
discipline, and mutual accountability.

######Acts 2:41-42, Acts 20:28, 1 Cor 12:12-2, 1 Cor 14:33, Eph 1:22-23, Eph. 2:11–3:6, Eph 4:4-16, Eph 5:23-32, Col 1:18, Heb 10:24-25, Heb 13: 7, Heb 13:17, 1 Tim 3:1-13, 1 Tim 5: 2 Tim 2:2, 2 Tim 2:15, Titus 1:5-9, 1 Peter 5:1-5


#####Water Baptism
Baptism is an ordinance, ordain by Jesus Christ, to be a public declaration of the believers fellowship with
Jesus in His death and resurrection.  In addition it is an external sign of the believers engrafting into Christ,
their remission of sins, and their submission to God through Christ to live and walk in newness of life
Although baptism is not required for salvation, it is commanded of all believers and is for believers only.

######Matt 28:19-20, Acts 2:38, Acts 8:12-13, Rom 6:4, Gal 3:27, Col 2:12


#####The Blessed Hope
The Bible clearly shows that the Believer has an assured hope and need not fear nor mourn death as the
world does.  Though the bodies of the redeemed after death return to dust, and undergo corruption, their
souls, which neither die nor sleep, immediately passes into the presence of God.  The souls of the righteous
will remain in paradise waiting for the full redemption of their bodies, whereupon their soul and body will be
reunited and glorified forever.  In contrast, upon death the souls of the wicked are cast into hell where they
remain reserved to the great Day of Judgment.

######Ecc 12:7, Dan 12:2, John 5:28-29, Rom 8:10-11, 1 Cor 15:35-52, 2 Cor 5:8, Phil 1:23, 1 Thes 4:13-18, Jude 6-7


#####The Second Coming & Reign of Christ
The scriptures gives proof that our Lord Jesus Christ will bodily return to translate His church from earth and
reward believers according to their works.  After Jesus’ glorious return He will occupy the throne of David and
establish His kingdom here upon the earth.  The culmination of all things is that the elements of this earth are
dissolved and replaced with a new earth wherein the saints dwell in fellowship with God forever in His heavenly
city.
